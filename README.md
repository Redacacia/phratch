=======

Phratch is based on Scratch with more features.

Phratch is a Scratch (http://scratch.mit.edu) port on Pharo2.0 and Pharo3.0. It is a programming language that makes it easy to create your own interactive stories, animations, games, music, and software in general.

Phratch is the evolution of the Scat project (https://code.google.com/p/scat/) which provided a port of Scratch on Pharo 1.3. Thanks to the developers of Scat, Phratch has strongly evolved to become a really cool tool. 

What really change:
  * change Menu
  * Settings
  * FileSystems
  * Metacello
  * integration of BYOB (allows to build your own blocks)
  * Integration of Panther (Category Color and Files)
  * A lot of new useful blocks
